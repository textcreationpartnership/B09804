            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>WHereas many and great Advantages have been Reapt by moſt Nations of Europ, from and by the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of that Rich and ſpatious Country <hi>Weſt-India,</hi> and yet many Rich and valuable Diſcoverys both of profit and place in the ſame, convenient for ſetlement are hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to unknown and unpoſeſt by Europeans.</p>
            <p>Which the Undertakers having been converſant in theſe parts, are ready to demonſtrate when occaſion requires with the advantages, that will acrue to all who ſhall be willing to adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture therein, either in perſon or purſe.</p>
            <p>And for the publick and univerſal Improvement of the ſaid Advantages in this and time to come, the Undertakers intend to manage the ſame by a Society to be called and known by the name of the general European Company for <hi>Weſt-India.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for the more free and eaſie management of this great and good undertaking, the Company do declare, that they will ſetle a free Port and Trade upon ſome convenient place in the ſaid Countries, for the Seat of Commerce between that and Europe, as well as other parts of the World.</p>
            <p>And ſince every man ought to be informed of the particular Advantages, before Adventure be made, none are obliged to ſubſcribe any ſum upon their Admiſſion into this Company, but the terms of ſuch Admiſſion ſhall only be ſubſcribing to the Conditions upon the Roll here underwritten.</p>
            <p>And he who is admitted in manner aforeſaid, ſhall ever after by himſelf, or Deputy, be duely informed of all the ſucceeding undertakings, and have vot and ſhare in the ſame ſuteable to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:191970:3"/>his Adventure, which is not to exceed ten thouſand Gilders in principale ſtock for any one man at any time for the firſt three years.</p>
            <p>And the ſame Company do reſolve from time to time, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fray all and every part of the Charge of their ſeveral underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings by their joynt conſent and common ſtocke.</p>
            <p>And as it may be neceſſary for the ſaid Society in time to come in ſome particular undertakings to make their Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the High and Mighty States, and other Governments of Europe, as well as particular perſons, ſo this as all other things, ſhall be done, as need require, by adviſe of the Company, and Charge of the Common ſtock.</p>
            <p>The Company think fit at preſent only to give this general account of things and publick Invitation for perſons to ſubſcribe reſerving the ſecrets of Trade, and the Company to the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, or ſuch as they ſhall order from time to time.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that are willing to enter into this Society, but would conceal their names for a time, may enter, or cauſe to be enterd what other name they pleaſe, and take a note from the Steward, to ſignify, that ſuch name is only in truſt for him provided, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way that ſuch notes of Truſt ſhall be produced, and the right Names enterd when the Aſſembly shall pleaſe to order it, leaſt by ſuch means one, or a few perſons under ſeveral names ſhould engroſe to themſelves too great an intereſt in this undertaking.</p>
            <p>The Members who have already ſubſcribed, have choſen and appointed <hi>Reſt Fenner,</hi> Bookſeller, near the Exchange in Amſterdam, being one of the Company, the preſent Steward to keep the Rolle, and take Subſcriptions until the meeting of the Aſſembly.</p>
            <p>All the perſons who live at a diſtance from Amſterdam, may ſend their Order in writting to any Friend, to doe it for them; but ſuch Orders muſt be filled up for the warrant of every one who ſubſcribes for his Friend; and ſuch Reſolutions of the Company as are needful to be made publick, ſhall be given in the Courants or by other publick Notice from time to time.</p>
            <p>The Underwritten is the Copy of the Rolle for Subſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:191970:3"/>
            <p>Whereas the Freedom and Liberty of the Worſhip of God, according to the holy Scriptures, is the firſt and moſt deſirable thing, and in the next place the Security of the Liberty, and property of the perſons and Eſtates of every man to him and his poſterity ſo far as humane prudence can extend it ſelf for the common good of mankind ought to be preſerved; Wee therefore doe reſolve and agree by Gods permiſſion to ſetle a free Port and Trade for all Nations in an Eminent part of <hi>Weſt-India,</hi> whereunto we are invited by a great and populous Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, where we ſhall not only by the Divine Aſſiſtance be capable of promoting the true Worſhip of God, but alſo of enriching our ſelves, and all that ſhall be concerned with us, and therefore We propoſe to our own and all other Chriſtian Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, who are deſirous to joyn in ſo glorious and great an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking to incorporate with us; reſolving to give and allow equal Priviledges and Advantages to all, according to their Merits. And becauſe ſo great an undertaking cannot be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually carried on without the concurrence of many perſons of ability and Subſtance, We do reſolve and agree that when we have received the Subſcriptions of Seventy perſons to this undertaking, a general meeting ſhall be appointed and held, where the whole Affair ſhall then be debated, and ſuch Officers, both Military and Civil as may ſeem convenient, ſhall be ſetled with the methods for effecting this great glorious and advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous Affair, which we queſtion not but God that hath inſpired us in the undertaking, will bleſs and proſper to the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing thereof; but in regard all things are intended to be managed by a Comon Stock, and the Advantages deſtributed according to the Quantum of every perſons ſubſcription, which cannot be brought to the deſired perfection, without ſome preſent Charge. It is therefore agreed that every Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criber ſhall depoſite the ſum of twenty Gilders upon his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, to be imployed for and towards the neceſſary charge of the promoting and obtaining the Subſcriptions, and meeting of the ſaid Aſſembly of Seventy, to whom affair and juſt Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count shall be given at their meeting, and then the Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of that Money and all ſuch Sums as ſhall then and after be
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:191970:4"/>ſubſcribed, ſhall be ordered and diſpoſed as they and future Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribers ſhall agree upon and direct from time to time.</p>
            <p>Whe whoſe names are hereunto ſubſcribed, do ingadge with, and incorporate our ſelves into the Society purſuant to the Ends above written.</p>
